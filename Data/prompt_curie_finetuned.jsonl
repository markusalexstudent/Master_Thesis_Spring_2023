farming partnership astrocast is providing avirtech with satellite iot satiot connectivity solutions for its biota intelligent farm control system this includes integrating its technology into avirtechs avirlink s communication nodes  this enables plantation owners to make legacy sensors smart by recording and controlling information remotely over long distances this partnership and technology integration provides avirtech the capability to offer clients connectivity in areas with limited or no terrestrialcellular connectivity such as mountainous areas access to satiot connectivity in these kinds of regions allows plantation owners to better track and understand plantation health using sensors that are connected to the cloud and iotbased digital agriculture helps users develop a connected plantation that is led by datadriven farming  tracking factors like weather temperature humidity rainfall data water level water quality and soil moisture many plantations are in remote areas where fixed line terrestrial and cellular connectivity is not ubiquitous this is not ideal for farmers and plantation owners  who are trying to adopt agriculture  and develop

connectivity and integrating its communication modules into our devices is enabling us to provide clients with the connectivity options required in these kinds of challenging regions it now means that

are priority concerns astrocasts smallsized devices offer low power consumption and long battery life up to  years these considerations become vital as organisations like avirtech embark upon deploying strategic satiot initiatives for clients further by combining goodquality battery technology with an intelligent approach to data transmission the lifecycle of iot solutions can be significantly extended rendy ferixsen ceo avirtech says after testing several other satellite solutions avirtech selected astrocast because it outperformed the competition on power consumption antenna size and cost bidirectional iot has a vital role to play here too the ability to send commands back to assets rather than just receive data is powerful it enables an array of new use cases including remote management of equipment farmers can command silos to release food open gates or manage irrigation systems without any need for expensive and often hardtosource human interaction with information seamlessly integrated with existing analytics ai or machine learning solutions organisations have the power to use this data to improve understanding and direct actions of remote assets
